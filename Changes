NOTE: semantics in this release change slighty when this used in a
debugger, e.g. $^P != 0. Previously, we might not give a location in
the source code, but instead a location in the debugger guts.

-  Semantics change noted above. We think this is what is normally desired,
   for an op-location even if it is incompatible.
-  Add optional level parameter that functions like builtin caller()
-  Change repository location in META.yml
-  Fully document callsite() and context() functions.
-  Don't use DynaLoader but use XSLoader instead.

0.07 - Oct 5, 2013
-  Add Perl Artistic License

0.06 - Sep 30, 2012
-  Make return values be unsigned integers (they are really pointers)
   Should fix some failing tests

0.05 - Sep 14, 2012
-  Use PERL_GET_CONTEXT rather than Perl_get_context(). The former macro
   works for code not built with threading. See
   https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=65625
-  Revise documentation to reflect that the return values are OP addresses
   (i.e. unsigned pointer values).
-  Rocky Bernstein takes over maintainership from Ted Zlatanov.
